        <h1>My First Book</h1>
        <p>After a vacation in Mexico, Chloe and Madison, two inseparable friends, return to Montreal, ready to resume their routine. But an unexpected encounter will change everything. Charles, a charismatic and mysterious man, crosses Chloe‚Äôs path and invites her for a weekend at his vast snowy estate in Vermont.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Initially hesitant, Chloe finally accepts the invitation, reassured by the presence of Madison and her boyfriend Kevin. Quickly, the trio finds themselves immersed in a sumptuous setting, between the imposing mansion and a more intimate chalet, lost in nature. Charles, an attentive and refined host, welcomes them with generosity that seems almost too perfect. Luxury, elaborate dinners, moments under the stars‚Ä¶ everything seems too good to be true.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But as night falls and shadows of the past resurface, a strange tension sets in the hushed atmosphere of the chalet.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As snow covers the landscape with an immaculate veil, the truth is about to be revealed‚Ä¶
        <br>and it may be colder than winter itself.</p>
