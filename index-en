        <h1>My First Book</h1>
        <p>After a dream vacation in Mexico, Chloe and Madison, two inseparable friends, return to Montreal, ready to resume their routine. But an unexpected encounter will change everything. Charles, a charismatic and mysterious man, crosses Chloe’s path and invites her to spend a weekend in his vast snow-covered estate in Vermont.

Initially hesitant, Chloe finally accepts the invitation, reassured by the presence of Madison and her boyfriend Kevin. Soon, the trio finds themselves immersed in a stunning setting, between the imposing manor and a more intimate chalet, lost in nature. Charles, an attentive and refined host, welcomes them with almost too-perfect generosity. Luxury, elaborate dinners, moments under the stars... everything seems too good to be true.

But as night falls and shadows of the past resurface, a strange tension creeps into the cozy atmosphere of the chalet. Intense gazes, heavy silences, details that don’t add up... Chloe begins to wonder if she made the right choice. What is Charles really hiding behind his enigmatic smile and almost obsessive attentions?

As the snow blankets the landscape in a pristine veil, the truth is about to be revealed... and it might be more chilling than winter itself.</p>

        <h2>Support My Writing</h2>
        <p>Writing is about exploring, bringing to life worlds where mystery, emotion, and the unexpected meet. My imagination is overflowing with projects – novels, gripping stories, and even screenplays ready to hit the big screen. But time is scarce, split between my passion and professional obligations.

Today, I want to take a step further: dedicate myself fully to writing, give my stories the space they deserve, and maybe even see them come to life in film. Your support is more than financial help: it’s a breath of encouragement that allows me to keep creating, publishing, and offering you stories that break the mold.

If you believe in the power of stories that transport and challenge, then join me on this literary and cinematic adventure. Every contribution is a brick added to this imaginative world we are building together.

Thank you so much for your support!</p>
